EXPLAIN 1:
Very simple, i copied and modified the Conference to make my Session so it is really similar.
a session is created from a parent key ( Conference )


For the speaker i simply used a StringField so any name could be added .

Queries : describe 2 queries:

1:  Get all session available in the morning only and that last between 60-90 minute . 

2. Get all session with highlights about programming python

Problem : 

solution : Query Session to find all session before 7 pm ( 19 ) and query session to find all typeofsession that doesn't equal workshop . with a for loop go through both query to find matching session returned and append them to a list. return the list.
